This contains two programs. The first, WeatherPy, demonstrates what the weather is like as one approaches the equator. It includes scatter and linear regression plots on key factors such as temperature, humidity and windspeed. All data has been called through OpenWeatherApi.

VacationPy filters through the file created in the first program to find an ideal vacation spot given key parameters and marks them on Gmaps.
